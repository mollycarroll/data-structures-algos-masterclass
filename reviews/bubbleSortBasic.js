/*
Basic implementation of bubble sort

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bubble-sort/
Run a nested for loop to traverse the input array using two variables i and j, such that 0 ≤ i < n-1 and 0 ≤ j < n-i-1
If arr[j] is greater than arr[j+1] then swap these adjacent elements, else move on
Print the sorted array
